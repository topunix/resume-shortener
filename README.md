# Blaster: to-do list

* Go with affiliate marketing. It's easier for you. 
* ~~Resume-rabbit has patents, so you must target individual recruiters~~
* ~~Consider emailing resumes, instead of uploading to websites~~
* ~~If you email, you should 'cc' the applicant?~~
* ~~Consider targeting smaller recruiters (easier to deal with). Must reach out to them. Should be generalists.~~
